DimesionalDatabase
==================

The idea is to create a database that supports viewing data as discrete points on an arbitrary number of dimensions.  Each dimension is effectively a key/value pair whose key describe the point on the dimension, and the dimension itself has other properties that determine its relationship to other dimensions.
